This repository contains the code to import and integrate the book and rating data that we work with.
It imports and integrates data from several sources in a single PostgreSQL database; import scripts
are primarily in Python, with Rust code for high-throughput processing of raw data files.

If you use these scripts in any published research, cite [our paper](https://md.ekstrandom.net/pubs/book-author-gender):

> Michael D. Ekstrand, Mucun Tian, Mohammed R. Imran Kazi, Hoda Mehrpouyan, and Daniel Kluver. 2018. Exploring Author Gender in Book Rating and Recommendation. In *Proceedings of the 12th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems* (RecSys '18). ACM, pp. 242â€“250. DOI:[10.1145/3240323.3240373](https://doi.org/10.1145/3240323.3240373). arXiv:[1808.07586v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07586v1) [cs.IR].

**Note:** the limitations section of the paper contains important information about
the limitations of the data these scripts compile.  **Do not use the gender information
in this data data or tools without understanding those limitations**.  In particular,
VIAF's gender information is incomplete and, in a number of cases, incorrect.

In addition, several of the data sets integrated by this project come from other sources
with their own publications.  **If you use any of the rating or interaction data, cite the
appropriate original source paper.**  For each data set below, we have provided a link to the
page that describes the data and its appropriate citation.

See the [documentation site](https://bookdata.piret.info) for details on using and extending
these tools.
