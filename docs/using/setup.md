# Setting Up the Environment
{: .no_toc}

These tools require PostgreSQL and an Anaconda installation.

## PostgreSQL Database

The book data tools require PostgreSQL (at least version 10), with the following extensions installed:

* [orafce](https://github.com/orafce/orafce)
* PostgreSQL Contrib (specifically `pg_prewarm` and `uuid-ossp`)

The database will take approximately 500GB.

Create a database for the book data, e.g. `bookdata`, owned by the database user you will be using to run the data integration tools.  The tools will create various tables and schemas.

Once you have created the database, run the following as the database superuser to enable the PostgreSQL extensions:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_prewarm;
CREATE EXTENSION orafce;
CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp";
```

## Import Tool Dependencies

The import tools are written in Python and Rust.  The provided `environment.yml` file defines an Anaconda environment (named `bookdata` by default) that contains all required runtimes and libraries:

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate bookdata

If you don't want to use Anaconda, see the following for more details on dependencies.

### Python

This needs the following Python dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or later
- psycopg2
- numpy
- tqdm
- pandas
- colorama
- chromalog
- natural
- dvc (0.90 or later)
- sqlparse
- sqlalchemy

### Rust

The Rust tools need Rust version 1.40 or later.  The easiest way to install this — besides Anaconda — is with
[rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

The `cargo` build tool will automatically download all Rust libraries required.  The Rust code does not depend on any specific system libraries.

## Database Configuration

All scripts read database configuration from the `DB_URL` environment variable, or alternately
a config file `db.cfg`.  This file should look like:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
host = localhost
database = bookdata
```

This file additionally supports branch-specfic configuration sections that will apply to work
on different Git branches, e.g.:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
host = localhost
database = bookdata

[master]
database = bdorig
```

This setup will use `bookdata` for most branches, but will connect to `bdorig` when working
from the `master` branch in the git repository.

This file should **not** be committed to Git.  It is ignored in `.gitignore`.
