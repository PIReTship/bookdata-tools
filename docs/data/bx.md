# BookCrossing
{: .no_toc}

The [BookCrossing data set](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/) consists of user-provided
ratings — both implicit and explicit — of books.

Imported data lives in the `bx` schema.  The source data files are automatically downloaded and unpacked by
the provided scripts and DVC stages.

## Import Steps

The import is controlled by the following DVC steps:

`data/BX.dvc`
:   Unpack the BookCrossing zip file.

`data/BX-CSV-Dump.zip.dvc`
:   Download the BookCrossing zip file.s

`schemas/bx-schema.dvc`
:   Run `bx-schema.sql` to set up the base schema.

`import/bx-ratings.dvc`
:   Import raw BookCrossing ratings from `data/BX-Book-Ratings.csv`.

`index/bx-index.dvc`
:   Run `bx-index.sql` to index the rating data and integrate with book data.

## Raw Data

The raw rating data, with invalid characters cleaned up, is in the `bx.raw_ratings` table, with
the following columns:

user_id
:   The user identifier (numeric).

isbn
:   The book ISBN (text).

rating
:   The book rating.  The ratings are on a 1-10 scale, with 0 indicating an implicit-feedback record.

## Extracted Rating Tables

We extract the following tables for BookCrossing ratings:

`rating`
:   The explicit ratings (`rating > 0`) from the raw ratings table.

`add_action`
:   Records of users adding books, either by rating or through an implicit feedback action,
    without rating values.

Both of these tables are pre-clustered, so the book IDs refer to book clusters and not individual
ISBNs or editions.  They have the following columns:

`user_id`
:   The user ID.

`book_id`
:   The [book code](ids.html#book-codes) for this book; the cluster identifier if available, or the
    ISBN-based book code if this book is not in a cluster.

`rating`
:   The rating value; if the user has rated multiple books in a cluster, the median value is reported.
    This field is only on the `rating` table.

`nactions`
:   The number of book actions this user performed on this book.  Equivalent to the number of books in
    the cluster that the user has added or rated.
