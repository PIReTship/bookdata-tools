# Amazon Ratings

This processes two data sets from Julian McAuley's group at UCSD:

- The [2014 Amazon reviews data set](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/)
- The [2018 Amazon reviews data set](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html)

Each consists of user-provided reviews and ratings for a variety of products.

Currently we import the ratings-only data from the Books segment of the 2014 and 2018 data sets.  Future versions of the data tools will support reviews.

**If you use this data, cite the paper(s) documented on the data set web site.**  For 2014 data:

Imported data lives in the `az2014` and `az2018` directories.  The source files
are not automatically downloaded â€” you will need to download the
**ratings-only** data for the Books category from each data site and save them
in the `data/az2014` and `data/az2018` directories.

## Import Steps

The import is controlled by the following DVC steps:

`scan-ratings`
:   Scan the rating CSV file into a Parquet file, converting user strings into numeric IDs.  Produces {file}`az2014/ratings.parquet`.

`cluster-ratings`
:   Link ratings with book clusters and aggregate by cluster, to produce user ratings for book clsuters.  Produces {file}`az2014/az-cluster-ratings.parquet`.

## Raw Data
