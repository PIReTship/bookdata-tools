Imported data lives in the `bx` directory.  The source data files are automatically downloaded and unpacked by
the provided scripts and DVC stages.

## Import Steps

The import is controlled by the following DVC steps:

`data/BX-CSV-Dump.zip.dvc`
:   Download the BookCrossing zip file.

`clean-ratings`
:   Unpack ratings from the downloaded zip file and clean up their invalid characters.

`cluster-ratings`
:   Combine BookCrossing ratings with [book clusters](cluster.qmd) to produce (user, cluster, rating) from the explicit-feedback ratings. BookCrossing implicit feedback entries (rating of 0) are excluded. Produces {{< file bx/bx-cluster-ratings.parquet >}}.

`cluster-actions`
:   Combine BookCrossing interactions with [book clusters](cluster.qmd) to produce (user, cluster) implicit-feedback records. These records include the BookCrossing implicit feedback entries (rating of 0). Produces {{< file bx/bx-cluster-actions.parquet >}}.

## Raw Data {#sec-bx-raw}

The raw rating data, with invalid characters cleaned up, is in the `bx/cleaned-ratings.csv`{#file:cleaned-ratings.csv} file.
It has the following columns:

`user_id`
:   The user identifier (numeric).

`isbn`
:   The book ISBN (text).

`rating`
:   The book rating $r_{ui}$.  The ratings are on a 1-10 scale, with 0 indicating an implicit-feedback record.

## Extracted Actions {#sec-bx-extracted}

`bx/bx-cluster-ratings.parquet`{#file:bx-cluster-ratings.parquet}
:   The explicit-feedback ratings ($r_{ui} > 0$ from {{< file bx/cleaned-ratings.csv >}}), with book clusters as the `item`s.

`bx/bx-cluster-actions.parquet`{#file:bx-cluster-actions.parquet}
:   All user-item interactions from {{< file bx/cleaned-ratings.csv >}}, with book clusters as the `item`s.
