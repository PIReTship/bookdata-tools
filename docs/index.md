# Book Data Tools

The PIReT Book Data Tools are a set of tools for ingesting, integrating, and indexing
a variety of sources of book data, created by the [People and Information Research Team](https://piret.info)
at [Boise State University](https://boisestate.edu).  The result of running these tools is a PostgreSQL
database with the raw data, various useful extracted features, and integrated identifiers across the various
data sources for cross-linking.

If you use these scripts in any published research, cite [our paper](https://md.ekstrandom.net/pubs/book-author-gender):

In *Proceedings of the 12th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems* (RecSys '18). ACM, pp. 242â€“250. DOI:[10.1145/3240323.3240373](https://doi.org/10.1145/3240323.3240373). arXiv:[1808.07586v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07586v1) [cs.IR].

The data integration is described in more detail in our [extended preprint](https://md.ekstrandom.net/pubs/bag-extended).

**Note:** the limitations section of the paper contains important information about
the limitations of the data these scripts compile.  **Do not use the gender information
in this data data or tools without understanding those limitations**.  In particular,
VIAF's gender information is incomplete and, in a number of cases, incorrect.

In addition, several of the data sets integrated by this project come from other sources
with their own publications.  **If you use any of the rating or interaction data, cite the
appropriate original source paper.**  For each data set below, we have provided a link to the
page that describes the data and its appropriate citation.
