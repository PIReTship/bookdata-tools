# Overview {.unnumbered}

The PIReT Book Data Tools are a set of tools for ingesting, integrating, and
indexing a variety of sources of book data, created by the [People and
Information Research Team](https://piret.info) at [Boise State
University](https://boisestate.edu).  The result of running these tools is a set
of Parquet files with raw data in a more usable form, various useful extracted
features, and integrated identifiers across the various data sources for
cross-linking.  These tools are updated from the version used to support our
original paper; we have dropped PostgreSQL in favor of a pipeline using DVC to
script extraction and integration tools implemented in Rust that is more
efficient (integration times have dropped from 8 hours to less than 3) and
requires significantly less disk space.[^bftag]

[^bftag]: The original tools are available on the `before-fusion` tag in the Git repository.

If you use these scripts in any published research, cite [our paper][paper] ([PDF][]):

> Michael D. Ekstrand and Daniel Kluver. 2021. Exploring Author Gender in Book Rating and Recommendation. <cite>User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction</cite> (February 2021) DOI:[10.1007/s11257-020-09284-2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11257-020-09284-2).

We also ask that you contact Michael Ekstrand to let us know about your use of the data, so we can
include your paper in our list of relying publications.

:::{note}
The limitations section of the paper contains important information about
the limitations of the data these scripts compile.  **Do not use the gender information
in this data data or tools without understanding those limitations**.  In particular,
VIAF's gender information is incomplete and, in a number of cases, incorrect.
:::

In addition, several of the data sets integrated by this project come from other sources
with their own publications.  **If you use any of the rating or interaction data, cite the
appropriate original source paper.**  For each data set below, we have provided a link to the
page that describes the data and its appropriate citation.

See the [Setup page](using/setup.md) to get started and for system requirements.

## Video

I recorded a video walking through the integration as an example for my [Data Science class](https://cs533.ekstrandom.net).
This discusses the PostgreSQL version of the integration, but the concepts have remained the same in terms of linking logic.
