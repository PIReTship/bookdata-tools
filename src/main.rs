//! Code for processing and integrating book data.
//!
//! The book data tools are developed as a monolithic executable.  The commands
//! themselves live under [cli], while the rest of the package contains data
//! definitions and helper routines that build on this code.  The tools are not
//! currently usable as a library; you can extend them by adding additional commands
//! to the [cli] module (`src/cli/` in the source tree).
